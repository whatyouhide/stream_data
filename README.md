# StreamData

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/whatyouhide/stream_data.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/whatyouhide/stream_data)
[![Hex.pm](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/stream_data.svg)](https://hex.pm/packages/stream_data)

> StreamData is an Elixir library for **data generation** and **property-based testing**.

*Note*: StreamData is in beta. It's a candidate to be included in Elixir itself at some point (but it's not guaranteed to).

## Installation

Add `stream_data` to your list of dependencies:

```elixir
defp deps() do
  [{:stream_data, "~> 0.1", only: :test}]
end
```

and run `mix deps.get`. StreamData is usually added only to the `:test` environment since it's used in tests and test data generation. To also import StreamData's formatter configuration, add `:stream_data` to your `.formatter.exs`:

```elixir
[
  import_deps: [:stream_data]
]
```

## Usage

[The documentation is available online.](https://hexdocs.pm/stream_data/)

StreamData is made of two main components: data generation and property-based testing. The `StreamData` module provides tools to work with data generation. The `ExUnitProperties` module takes care of the property-based testing functionality.

### Data generation

All data generation functionality is provided in the `StreamData` module. `StreamData` provides "generators" and functions to combine those generators and create new ones. Since generators implement the `Enumerable` protocol, it's easy to use them as infinite streams of data:

```elixir
StreamData.integer() |> Stream.map(&abs/1) |> Enum.take(3)
#=> [1, 0, 2]
```

`StreamData` provides all the necessary tools to create arbitrarily complex custom generators:

```elixir
require ExUnitProperties

domains = [
  "gmail.com",
  "hotmail.com",
  "yahoo.com",
]

email_generator =
  ExUnitProperties.gen all name <- StreamData.string(:alphanumeric),
                           name != "",
                           domain <- StreamData.member_of(domains) do
    name <> "@" <> domain
  end

Enum.take(StreamData.resize(email_generator, 20), 2)
#=> ["efsT6Px@hotmail.com", "swEowmk7mW0VmkJDF@yahoo.com"]
```

### Property testing

Property testing aims at randomizing test data in order to make tests more robust. Instead of writing a bunch of inputs and expected outputs by hand, with property-based testing we write a *property* of our code that should hold for a set of data, and then we generated data in this set to verify that property. To generate this data, we can use the above-mentioned `StreamData` module.

```elixir
use ExUnitProperties

property "bin1 <> bin2 always starts with bin1" do
  check all bin1 <- binary(),
            bin2 <- binary() do
    assert String.starts_with?(bin1 <> bin2, bin1)
  end
end
```

To know more about property-based testing, read the `ExUnitProperties` documentation. Another great resource about property-based testing in Erlang (but with most ideas that apply to Elixir as well) is Fred Hebert's website [propertesting.com](http://propertesting.com).

The property-based testing side of this library is heavily inspired by the [original QuickCheck paper](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/john-hughes/quick.pdf) (which targeted Haskell) as well as Clojure's take on property-based testing, [test.check](https://github.com/clojure/test.check).
