> StreamData is an Elixir library for **data generation** and **property-based testing**.

Read [the announcement on the Elixir website](https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2017/10/31/stream-data-property-based-testing-and-data-generation-for-elixir/).

## Installation

Add `stream_data` to your list of dependencies:

```elixir
defp deps() do
  [{:stream_data, "~> 0.1", only: :test}]
end
```

and run `mix deps.get`. StreamData is usually added only to the `:test` environment since it's used in tests and test data generation.
To also import StreamData's formatter configuration, add the `:dev`  environment as well as `:test` for `stream_data` and add `:stream_data` to your `.formatter.exs`:

```elixir
[
  import_deps: [:stream_data]
]
```

## Usage

[The documentation is available online.](https://hexdocs.pm/stream_data/)

StreamData is made of two main components: data generation and property-based testing. The `StreamData` module provides tools to work with data generation. The `ExUnitProperties` module takes care of the property-based testing functionality.

### Data generation

All data generation functionality is provided in the `StreamData` module. `StreamData` provides "generators" and functions to combine those generators and create new ones. Since generators implement the `Enumerable` protocol, it's easy to use them as infinite streams of data:

```elixir
StreamData.integer() |> Stream.map(&abs/1) |> Enum.take(3)
#=> [1, 0, 2]
```

`StreamData` provides all the necessary tools to create arbitrarily complex custom generators:

```elixir
require ExUnitProperties

domains = [
  "gmail.com",
  "hotmail.com",
  "yahoo.com",
]

email_generator =
  ExUnitProperties.gen all name <- StreamData.string(:alphanumeric),
                           name != "",
                           domain <- StreamData.member_of(domains) do
    name <> "@" <> domain
  end

Enum.take(StreamData.resize(email_generator, 20), 2)
#=> ["efsT6Px@hotmail.com", "swEowmk7mW0VmkJDF@yahoo.com"]
```

### Property testing

Property testing aims at randomizing test data in order to make tests more robust. Instead of writing a bunch of inputs and expected outputs by hand, with property-based testing we write a *property* of our code that should hold for a set of data, and then we generated data in this set to verify that property. To generate this data, we can use the above-mentioned `StreamData` module.

```elixir
use ExUnitProperties

property "bin1 <> bin2 always starts with bin1" do
  check all bin1 <- binary(),
            bin2 <- binary() do
    assert String.starts_with?(bin1 <> bin2, bin1)
  end
end
```

To know more about property-based testing, read the `ExUnitProperties` documentation. Another great resource about property-based testing in Erlang (but with most ideas that apply to Elixir as well) is Fred Hebert's website [propertesting.com](http://propertesting.com).

The property-based testing side of this library is heavily inspired by the [original QuickCheck paper](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/john-hughes/quick.pdf) (which targeted Haskell) as well as Clojure's take on property-based testing, [test.check](https://github.com/clojure/test.check).

## Differences from other property-based testing frameworks

There are a handful of property-based testing frameworks for the BEAM ecosystem (Erlang, Elixir, and so on). For Elixir, the main alternative to StreamData is [PropCheck](https://github.com/alfert/propcheck). PropCheck is a wrapper around [PropEr](https://github.com/proper-testing/proper), which is a property-based testing framework for Erlang. There are a few fundamental differences between StreamData and PropEr. They are listed below to help you choose between the two.

**PropEr** (via PropCheck):

  * It provides *stateful property-based testing*. If you need to test a system with state by building a model of the system to test against, you'll have to go with PropCheck since StreamData doesn't support this yet.

  * It can store counter-examples: StreamData doesn't support storing counter-examples in a file (you have to reuse the seed that caused the failure in order to reproduce it).

**StreamData**:

  * Provides functionality for generating data as the base for property-based testing. StreamData generators can be used outside of property-based testing as normal Elixir streams that produce random data.

  * It is native to Elixir. It's written entirely in Elixir and has an idiomatic Elixir API (for example, all generators are Elixir enumerables).
